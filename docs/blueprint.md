- Background color: Light green (#E0F0D8), subtly tinted with green (desaturated from the primary) to give an airy and spacious impression.
- Accent color: Terracotta (#E07A5F), selected as an analogous color, will be used for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif font for a clean and modern look; body: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font with a little warmth and personality.
- Use location and transportation-related icons in a minimalist style.
- Clean and intuitive map-centric layout with clear visual hierarchy.
- Smooth transitions and map interactions to enhance user experience.
